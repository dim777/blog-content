## Configuration settings
### shared_buffers
Postgres doesn't work directly with storage system - only via cache buffer. Then wal logs write to disc.
When serivice is trying to select data from table - it means that firstly data will be querird from buffer -> system file cache -> disc
Shared buffer divided between all postgres server processes.

Simple calculator:
- 1/4 server RAM
- vmstat for fine tuning
