# Data mesh
## 
My First Law of Architecture is: "Whatever architecture you design is wrong; either now because you didn’t understand the requirements fully, or eventually because something changes."

- All data consumers should be tolerant of multiple delivery (business logic level)
- All data consumers should be tolerant of out-of-order delivery for up to N seconds
- All data producers should produce idempotent records
- Event sourcing is usually more complex than necessary. Start by publishing “fat objects” for your records tenants and come back to event sourcing if you really need it.
